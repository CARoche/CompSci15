      <h2>
      <p style="font-size: 25px"> My name is Christopher Roche, and I am from San Carlos, California, and I currently attend Summit Preparatory Charter High School. I have  grown up in the state of California, more specifically the Bay Area; I have traveled to many different locations in the past year including: Alaska, Hawaii, South Central LA, and Washington. I am a very impulsive person, but I do tend to follow passions that I have. I love trying out new things, including instruments, games, sports, foods, and many other activities. My most recent of things would be my recent purchase of a Banjo, albeit learning how to play the instrument is much harder than expected. </p>
