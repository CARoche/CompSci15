    <h1> About HTML </h1>
    <p> HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language. It is many commands within brackets that when inserted to a browser, make up a webpage. It was originally used by researchers at the CERN supercollider at Switzerland as a way of making a list of commands in order to combine into a webpage as a whole. </p>
  <h2> Tags </h2>
    <p> Tags are elements of HTML that are what create the overall webpage, every little detail written in HTML starts with a beginning tag, and an end tag. For example if I want to write a paragraph I would need to start it with a beginning tag of <.p.> and an end tag of <./p.> (Minus the periods between the brackets).</p>
    <h3> Attributes </h3>
    <p> Attributes are different types of things that you can insert into HTML, such as: links, images, and titles.</p>
  <h4> CSS </h4>
    <p> CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets, it is mainly used in conjunction with HTML for making webpages. CSS can change the style of certain elements on a webpage. It was also created by researchers at CERN as a result of the desire for other style sheet languages for the web.</p>
